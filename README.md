To attain a sentiment score of the text, I used the VADER Sentiment Analyzer from the Python Natrual Language Toolkit library. From this library, I used the polarity scores funciton to get the overall sentiment score of the text, as well as individual positive, negative, and neutral scores.
The compound sentiment score given by the script ranges from -1 to 1, with greater values reprenting more positive sentiment. The end result of the script was a compound sentiment score of 0.9982, indicating that the passage uses primarily language with positive connotation. This was fairly surprising to me, given how mixed the language is throughout the text, with there being both very positive and very negative language present.
By observing the sentiment score of the individual sentences, it's apparent how hectic the sentiment of the passage is, with there being very large spikes in both the positive and negative directions. Although, the passage becomes more positive over time, with there not being a sentence with negative sentiment past sentence 20.
